        <h2>Accents</h2>
        <p>
          Accents show which notes should pop out of the pattern. They don’t change
          the rhythm, but they change the sound and energy of the line.
        </p>

        <h3>Basic Accent (&gt;)</h3>
        <p>
          A basic accent is shown with a small “&gt;” above the note. Hit these notes
          slightly louder than the regular notes around them.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Placed above the note head</li>

        <h3>Unaccented Notes</h3>
        <p>
          Notes without an accent mark should be played softer and more relaxed.
          The contrast between accented and unaccented notes creates groove.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Use a lower stick height</li>

        <h3>Building Accent Patterns</h3>
        <p>
          Accents are often placed on specific beats or parts of a phrase to shape
          the rhythm. You might see them on every “&amp;” or just on downbeats.
        </p>

        <h3>Accent Example</h3>
        <p>
          Here is a simple pattern where only some of the notes are accented. When you
          play it, focus on keeping the unaccented notes soft and even while the
          accented notes are strong and clear.

      <h3>Next: Sticking &amp; Notation</h3>
      <p>
        After you understand accents, you can connect them to sticking patterns to
        control which hand plays each note.
